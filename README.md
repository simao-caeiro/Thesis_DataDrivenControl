# Data-Driven Control of UAVs

## SPC vs DeePC
To analyse the case of the deterministic linear system, run main_wo_noise.py.

To simulate the case of the non-deterministic linear system, run main_noise.py.

The results are created using Python code and the toolboxes:
- numpy
- control
- matplotlib
- scipy
- CasADi
