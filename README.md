## DeePC algorithm provided by the authors
To analyse the linear case, run DeePC_Authors+Linear\DeePC_main.m.

To simulate the nonlinear case, run DeePC_Authors+Nonlinear\DeePC_main.m.

## Novel DeePC algorithm
To analyse the linear case, run DeePC+Linear\DeePC_main.m.

To simulate the nonlinear case, run DeePC+Nonlinear\DeePC_main.m.

## LQR
To simulate a nonlinear response using LQR controller, run LQR\LQR_main.m.

## MPC
To simulate a linear response using MPC controller, run MPC\Linear\MPC_main.m.

To simulate a nonlinear response using MPC controller, run MPC\Nonlinear\MPC_main.m.

## Results

The results are obtained using Matlab code and the osqp toolbox. To install this toolbox, run install_osqp.m.
